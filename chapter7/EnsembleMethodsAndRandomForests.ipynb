    "# Ensemble Learning and Random Forests\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you ask a complex question to thousands of random people, then aggregate their answers. In many cases you will find that this aggregated answer is better than an expert's answer. This is called the *wisdom of the crowd*. Similarly, if you aggregate the predictions of a group of predictors (such as classifiers or regressors), you will often get better predictions than with the best individual predictor. A group of predictors is called an *ensemble*; thus, this technique is called *Ensemble Learning*, and an Ensemble Learning algorithm is called an *Ensemble method*.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, you can train a group of Decision Tree classifiers, each on a different random subset of the training set. To make predictions, you just obtain the predictions of all individual trees, then predict the class that gets the most votes. Such an ensemble of Decision Trees is called a Random Forest, and despite its simplicity, this is one of the most powerful Machine Learning algorithms available today.\n",
    "\n",
    "Moreover, you will often use Ensemble methods near the end of a project, once you have already built a few good predictors, to combine them into an even better predictor. In fact, the winning solutions in Machine Learning competitions often involve several Ensemble methods.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will discuss the most popular Ensemble methods, including *bagging*, *boosting*, *stacking*, and a few others. We will also explore Random Forests.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Voting Classifiers\n",
    "\n",
    "Suppose you have trained a few classifiers, each one achieving about 80% accuracy. You may have a Logistic Regression classifier, an SVM classifier, a Random Forest classifier, a K-Nearest Neighbors classifiers, and perhaps a few more.\n",
    "\n",
    "A very simple way to create an even better classifier is to aggregate the predictions of each classifier and predict the class that gets the most votes. This majority-vote classifier is called a *hard voting* classifier.\n",
    "\n",
    "Somewhat surprisingly, this voting classifier often achieves a higher accuracy than the best classifier in the esemble. In fact, even if each classifier is a *weak learner* (meaning it does only slighly better than random guessing), the ensemble can still be a *strong learner* (achieving high accuracy, provided there are a sufficient number of weak learners and they are sufficiently diverse.\n",
    "\n",
    "How is this possible? The following analogy can help shed some light on this mistery. Suppose you have a slighly biased coin that has a 51% chance of coming up heads, and 49% chance of coming up tails. If you toss it 1000 times, you will generally get more or less 510 heads and 490 tails, and hence a majority of heads. If you do the math, you will find that the probability of obtaining a majority of heads after 1000 tosses is close to 75%. The more you toss the coin, the higher the probability (e.g. with 10000 tosses, the probability climbs over 97%). This is due to the *law of large number*: as you keep tossing the coin, the ratio of heads gets closer and closer to the probability of heads.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, suppose you build an esemble containing 1000 classifiers that are individually correct only 51% of the time (barely better than random guessing). If you predict the majority voted class, you can hope for up to 75% accuracy! However, this is only true if all classifiers are perfectly independent, making uncorrelated errors, which is clearly not the case since they are trained on the same data. They are likely to make the same type of errors, so there will be many majority votes for the wrong class, reducing the ensemble's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Note**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Ensemble methods work best when the predictors are as independent from one another as possible. One way to get diverse classifiers is to train them using very different algorithms. This increases the chance that they will make very different types of errors, improving the ensemble's accuracy.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code creates nad trains a voting classifier in Scikit-Learn, composed of three diverse classifiers (the training set is the moons dataset)."

    "If all classifier are able to estimate class probabilities (i.e., they have a predict_proba() method), then you can tell Scikit-Learn to predict the class with the highest class probability, averaged over all the individual classifiers. This is called *soft voting*. It often achieves higher performance than hard voting because it gives more weight to highly confident votes. All you need to do is replace voting = \"hard\" with voting = \"soft\" and ensure that all classifiers can estimate class probabilities. This is not the case of the SVC class by default, so you need to set its probability hyperparameter to True (this will make the SVC class use cross-validation to estimate class probabilities, slowing down training, and it will add a predict_proba() method). \n",
    "\n",
    "## Bagging and Pasting\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to get a diverse set of classifiers is to use very different training algorithms, as just discussed. Another approach is to use the same training algorithm for every predictor, but to train them on different random subsets of the training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "When sampling is performed *with* replacement, this method is called *bagging* (short for *boostrap aggregating*). \n",
    "\n",
    "When sampling is performed *without replacement*, it is called *pasting*.\n",
    "\n",
    "In other words, both bagging and pasting allow training instances to be sampled several times across multiple predictors, but only bagging allows training instances to be sampled several times for the same predictor. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once all predictors are trained, the ensemble can make a prediction for a new instance by simply aggregating the predictions of all predictors. The aggregation function is typically the *statistical mode* (i.e. the most frequent prediction, just like a hard voting classifier) for classification, or the average for regression. Each individual predictor has a higher bias than if it were trained on the original training set, but aggregation reduces both bias and variance. Generally, the net result is that the ensemble has a similar bias but a lower variance than a single predidctor trained on the original training set. \n",
    "\n",
    "Predictors can all be trained in parallel, via different CPU cores or even different servers. Similarly, predictions can be made in parallel. This is one of the reasons why bagging and pasting are such popular methods: they scale very well.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Bagging and Pasting in Scikit-Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn offers a simple API for both bagging and pasting with the BaggingClassifier class (or BaggingRegressor for regression). The following code trains an ensemble of 500 Decision Tree classifiers, each trained on 100 training instances randomly sampled from the training set with replacement (this is an example of bagging, but if you want to use pasting instead, just set bootstrap = False). \n",

    "\n",
    "Bootstrapping introduces a bit more diversity in the subset that each predictor is trained on; so bagging ends up with a slighly higher bias than pasting, but this also means that predictors end up being less correlated so the ensemble's variance is reduced. Overall, bagging often results in better models, which explains why it is generally preferred. However, if you have spare time and CPU power you can use cross-validation to evaluate both bagging and pasting and select the one that works best.\n",

    "With bagging, some instances may be sampled several times for any given predictor, while others may not be sampled at all.

This means that only about 63% of the training instances are sampled on average for each predictor. The remaining 37% of the training instances that are not sampled are called *out-of-bag* (oob) instances. Note that they are not the same 37% for all predictors. \n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "This is particularly useful when you are dealing with high-dimensional inputs (such as images). Sampling both training instances and features is called the *Random Patches* method. Keeping all training instances (i.e. bootstrap = False, and max_samples = 1.0) but sampling features (i.e. bootstrap_features = True and/or max_features smaller than 1.0) is called the *Random Subspaces* method.\n",

More precisley, it is a weighted average, where each node's weight is equal to the number of training samples that are associated with it.\n",

You can access the result using the feature_importances_ variable. For example, the following code trains a RandomForestClassifier on the iris dataset and outputs each feature's importance. It seems that the most important features are the petal length and width, while sepal lenght and width are rather unimportant in comparison:"

    "## Boosting\n",
    "\n",
    "*Boosting* (originally called *hypothesis boosting*) refers to any Ensemble method that can combine several weak learners into a strong learner. The general idea of most boosting methods is to train predictors sequentially, each trying to correct its predecessor. There are many boosting methods available, but by far the most popular are *AdaBoost* (short for Adaptive Boosting) and *Gradient Boosting*. Let's start with AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "### AdaBoost\n",
    "\n",
    "One way for a new predictor to correct its predecessor is to pay a bit more attention to the training ainstances that the predecessor underfitted. This results in new predictors focusing more and more on the hard cases. This is the technique used by AdaBoost.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, to build an AdaBoost classifier, a first base classifier (such as a Decision Tree) is trained and used to make predictions on the training set. The relative weight of misclassified training instances is then increased. A second classifier is trained using the updated weights and again it makes predictions on the training set, weights are updated and so on.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once all predictors are trained, the ensemble makes predictions very much like bagging or pasting, except that predictors have different weights depending on their overall accuracy on the weighted trainining set.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "There is one important drawback to this sequential learning technique: it cannot be parallelized (or only partially), since each predictor can only be trained after the previous predictor has been trained and evaluated. As a result, it does not scale as well as bagging or pasting.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's take a closer look at the AdaBoost algorithm. Each instance weight $w^{(i)}$ is initially set to $\\frac{1}{m}$. A first predictor is trained and its weighted error rate $r_1$ is computed on the training set:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ r_j = \\frac{\\sum_{\\substack{i = 1 \\\\ \\hat{y_j^{(i)}} \\neq y^{(i)}}}^m w^{(i)}}{\\sum_{i = 1}^m w^{(i)}} $$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\hat{y_j^{(i)}}$ is the $j^{th}$ predictor's prediction for the $i^{th}$ instance.\n",
    "\n",
    "The predictor's weight $\\alpha_j$ is then computed using the equation below, where $\\eta$ is the learning rate hyperparameter (defaults to 1). The more accurate the predictor is, the higher its weight will be. If it is just guessing randomly, then its weight will be close to zero. However, if it is most often wrong (i.e. less accurate than random guessing), then its weight will be negative.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\alpha_j = \\eta log \\frac{1- r_j}{r_j}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Next the instance weights are updated using the equation below: the misclassified instances are boosted.\n",
    "\n",
    "for i = 1,2, ..., m\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "$ w^{(i)} \\gets  \\begin{cases}\n",
    "      w^{(i)} \\; \\text{ if } \\hat{y_j^{(i)}} = y^{(i)}\\\\\n",
    "      \\\\\n",
    "      w^{(i)} exp (\\alpha_j) \\; \\text{ if } \\hat{y_j^{(i)}} \\neq y^{(i)}\n",
    "    \\end{cases}     $\n",
    "\n",
    "Then all the instance weights are normalized (i.e. divided by $\\sum_{i = 1}^m w^{(i)}$).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a new predictor is trained using the updated weights, and the whole process is repeated (the new predictor's weight is computed, the instance weights are updated, then another predictor is trained, and so on). The algorithm stops when the desired number of predictors is reached, or when a perfect predictor is found.\n",
    "\n",
    "To make predictions, AdaBoost simply computes the predictions of all the predictors and weights them using the predictor weights $\\alpha_j$. The predicted class it the one that receives the majority of weigthed votes (see equation below):\n",
    "\n",
    "$$ \\hat{y}(x) = \\underset{k}{\\operatorname{argmax}} \\sum_{\\substack{j = 1 \\\\ \\hat{y}_j(x) = k}}^N \\alpha_j$$  where N is the number of predictors\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Scikit-Learn actually uses a multiclass version of AdaBoost called SAMME (which stands for *Stagewise Additive Modeling using a Multiclass Exponential loss function*). When there are just two classes, SAMME is equivalent to AdaBoost. Moreover, if the predictors can estimate class probabilities (i.e. if they have a predict_proba() method), Scikit-Learn can use a variant of SAMME called SAMME.R (the R stands for \"Real\"), which relies on class probabilities rather than predictions and generally performs better.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following code trains an AdaBoost classifier based on 200  *Decision Stumps* using Scikit-Learn's AdaBoostClassifier class (as you might expect, there is also an AdaBoostRegressor class).

    "The last Ensemble method we will disuss in this chapter is called *stacking* (short for *stacked generalization*). It is based on a simple idea: instead of using trivial functions (such as hard voting) to aggregate the predictions of all predictors in an esemble, why don't we train a model to perform this aggregation? See figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](stacking.PNG \"Decision Tree\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of the bottom three predictors predicts a different value, and then the final predictor (called a *blender*, or a *meta learner*) takes the predictions as inputs and makes the final prediction.\n",
    "\n",
    "To train a blender, a common approach is to use a hold-out set. \n",
    "\n",
    "First, the training set is split in two subsets. The first subset is used to train the predictors in the first layer.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, the first layer predictors are used to make predictions on the second (held-out) set. This ensures that the predictions are \"clean\", since the predictors never saw these instances during training. Now for each instance in the hold-out set there are three predicted values. We an create a new training set using these predicted values as input features (which makes this new training set three-dimensional), and keeping the target values. The blender is trained on this new training set, so it learns to predict the target value given the first layer's predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is actually possible to train several different blenders this way (e.g. one using Linear Regression, another uisng Random Forest Regression, and so on): we get a whole layer of blenders. The trick is to split the training set into three subsets: the first one is used to train the first layer, the second one is used to create the training set used to train the second layer (using predictions made by the predictors of the first layer), and the third one is usced to create the training set to train the third layer (using predictions made by the predictors of the second layer). Once this is done, we can make a prediction for a new instance by going through each layer sequentially.\n",
    "\n",
    "Unfortunately, Scikit-Learn does not support stacking directly, but it is not too hard to roll out your implementation. Alternatively you can use an open source implementation such as brew."
