    "# Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Many Machine Learning problems involve thousands or even millions of features for each training instance. Not only does this make training extremely slow, it can also make it much harder to find a good solution, as we will see. This problem is often referred to as *curse of dimensionality*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fortunately, in real-world problems, it is often possible to reduce the number of features considerably, turning an intractable problem into a tractable one. For example, consider the MNIST images: the pixels on the image borders are almost always white, so you could completely drop these pixels from the training set without losing much information. Moreover, two neighboring pixels are often highly correlated: if you merge them into a single pixel (e.g. by taking the mean of the two pixel intensities), you will not lose much information.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Caution**:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reducing dimensionality does lose some information (just ike compressing an image to JPEG can degrade its quality), so even though it will speed up training, it may also make your system perform slighly worse. It also makes your pipelines a bit more complex and thus harder to maintain. So you should first try to train your system with the original data before considering using dimensionaliy reduction if training is too slow. In some cases, however, reducing the dimensionality of the training data may filter out some noise and unnecessary details and thus result in higher preformance (but in general it won't; it will just speed up training).\n",
    "\n",
    "Apart from speeding up training, dimensionality reduction is also extremely useful for data visualization (DataViz). Reducing the number of dimensions down to two (or three) makes it possible to plot a condensed view of a high-dimensional training set on a graph and often fain some important insights by visually detecting patterns, such as clusters. Moreover, DataViz is essential to communicate your conclusions to people who are not data scientists, in particular decision makers who will use your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this chapter we will discuss the curse of dimensionality and get a sense of what goes on in high-dimensional space. Then, we will present the two main approaches to dimensionality reduction (projection and Manifold Learning), and we will go through three of the most popular dimensionality reduction techniques: PCA, Kernel PCA, and LLE.\n",
    "\n",
    "## The Curse of Dimensionality\n",
    "\n",
    "We are so used to living in three dimensions that our intuition fails us when we try to imagine a high-dimensional space. Even a basic 4D hypercube is incredibly hard to picture in our mind, let alone a 200-dimensional ellipsoid bent in a 1000-dimensional space.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that many things behave very differently in high-dimensional space. For example, if you pick a random point in a unit square (a 1x1 square), it will have only about a 0.4% chance of being located less than 0.001 from a border (in other words, it is very unlikely that a random point will be \"extreme\" along any dimension). But in a 10,000 dimensional unit hypercube (a 1x1x...x1 cube, with ten thousands 1s), this probability is greater than 99.99999%. Most points in a high-dimensional hypercube are very close to the border.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is a more troublesome difference: if you pick two points randomly in a unit square, the distance between these two points will be, on average, roughly 0.52. If you pick two random points in a unit 3D cube, the average distance will be roughly 0.66. But what about two points picked randomly in a 1M-dimensional hypercube? Well, the average distance, believe it or not, will be about 408.25! This is quite counterintuitive: how can two points be so far apat when they both lie within the same hypercube? This fact implies that high-dimensional datasets are at risk of being very sparse: most trainining instances are likely to be far away from each other. Of course, this also means that a new instance will likely be far away from any training instance, making predictions much less reliable than in lower dimensions, since they will be based on much larger extrapolations. \n",
    "\n",
    "In short, the more dimensions the training set has, the greater the risk of overfitting it.\n",
    "\n",
    "In theory, one solution to the curse of dimensionality could be to increase the size of the training set to reach a sufficient density of training instances. Unfortunately, in practice, the number of training instances required to reach a given density grows exponentially with the number of dimensions. With just 100 features (much less than in the MNIST problem -~780), you would need more training instances than atoms in the observable universe in order for training instances to be within 0.1 of each other on average, assuming they were spread out uniformly across all dimensions.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Main Approaches for Dimensionality Reduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we dive into specific dimensionality reduction algorithms, let's take a look at the two main approaches to reducing dimensionality: projection and Manifold Learning.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Projection\n",
    "\n",
    "In most real-world problems, training instances are *not* spread out uniformly across all dimensions. Many features are almost constant, while others are highly correlated (as discussed earlier for MNIST). As a result, all training instances actually lie within (or close to) a much lower-dimensional *subspace* of the high-dimensional space (image below). \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](highD.PNG \"High Dimensional\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Notice that all training instances lie close to a plane: this is a lower-dimensional (2D) subspace of the high-dimensional (3D) space. Now if we project every training instance perpendicularly onto this subspace (as represented by the short lines connecting the instances to the plane), we get the new 2D dataset shown in the image below. We have just reduced the dataset's dimensionality from 3D to 2D. Note that the axes correspond to new features $z_1$ and $z_2$ (the coordinates of the projections on the plane).\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](lessD.PNG \"Less high Dimensional\")\n",
    "\n",
    "However, projection is not always the best approach to dimensionality reduction. In many cases the subspace may twist and turn, such as in the infamour *Swiss roll* toy dataset in the figure below:\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](swiss3d.PNG \"Swiss 3d\")\n",
    "\n",
    "Simply projecting onto a plane (e.g. by dropping $x_3$) would squash different layers of the Swiss roll together, as shown on the left of the figure below. However, what you really want is to unroll the Swiss roll to obtain the 2D dataset on the right\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](swiss2d.PNG \"Swiss 2d\")\n",
    "\n",
    "### Manifold Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "The Swiss roll is an example of a 2D *manifold*. Put simply, a 2D manifold is a 2D shape that can be bent and twisted in a higher-dimensional space. More generally, a d-dimensional manifold is a part of an n-dimensional space (where d < n) that locally resembles a d-dimensional hyperplane. In the case of the Swiss roll, d = 2 and n = 3: it locally resembles a 2D plane, but it is rolled in the third dimension.\n",
    "\n",
    "Many dimensionality reduction algorithms work by modeling the *manifold* on which the training instances lie; this is called *Manifold Learning*. It relies on the *manifold assumption*, also called the *manifold hypothesis*, which holds that most real-world high-dimensional datasets lie close to a much lower-dimensional manifold. This assumption is very often empirically observed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once again, think about the MNIST dataset: all handwritten digit images have some similarities. They are made of connected lines, the borders are white, they are more or less centered, and so on. If you randomly generated images, only a ridiculously tiny fraction of them would look like handwritten digits. In other words, the degrees of freedom available to you if you try to create a digit image are dramatically lower than the degrees of freedom you would have if you were allowed to generate any image you wanted. These constraints tend to squeeze the dataset into a lower-dimensional manifold.\n",
    "\n",
    "The manifold assumption is often accompanied by another implicit assumption: that the task at hand (e.g. classification or regression) will be simpler if expressed in the lower-dimensional space of the manifold. However, this assumption does not always hold.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, if you reduce the dimensionality of your training set before training a model, it will usually speed up training, but it may not always lead to a better or simpler solution; it all depends on the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "## PCA\n",
    "\n",
    "*Principal Component Analysis* (PCA) is by far the most popular dimensionality reduction algorithm. First it identifies the hyperplane that lies closest to the data, and then it **projects** the data onto it.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Preserving the Variance\n",
    "\n",
    "Before you can project the training set onto a lower-dimensional hyperplane, you first need to choose the right hyperplane. For example, a simple 2D dataset is represented in the left of the figure below, along with three different axes (i.e. one-dimensioanl hyperplanes). On the right is the result of the projection of the dataset onto each of these axes. As you can see, the projection onto the solid line preserves the maximum variance.\n",
    "\n",
    "![alt text](PCA.PNG \"PCA\")\n",
    "\n",
    "It seems reasonable to select the axis that preserves the maximum amount of variance, as it will most likely lose less information than the other projections. Another way to justify this choice is that it is the axis that minimizes the mean squared distance between the original dataset and its projection onto that axis (closest to the data).\n",
    "\n",
    "### Principal Components\n",
    "\n",
    "PCA identifies the axis that accounts for the largest amount of variance in the training set. It also finds a second axis, orthogonal to the first one, that accounts for the largest amount of the remaining variance. In the 2D example above there is no choice: it is the dotted line. If it were a higher-dimensional dataset, PCA would also find a third axis, orthogonal to both previous axes, and a fourth, a fifth, and so on -- as many axes as the number of dimensions in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "The unit vector that defines the $i^{th}$ axis is called the $i^{th}$ *principal component*\n",
    " (PC). In the figure above, the $1^{st}$ PC is $c_1$ and the $2^{nd}$ PC is $c_2$.\n",
    " \n",
    " **Note**:\n",
    " \n",
    " The direction of the principal components is not stable: if you perturb the training set slighly and run PCA again, some of the new PCs may point in the opposite direction of the original PCs. However, they will generally still lie on the same axes. In some cases, a pair of PCs may even rotate or swap, but the plane they define will generally remain the same.\n",
    " \n",
    " So how can you find the principal components of a training set? Luckily, there is a standard matrix factorization technique called *Singular Value Decomposition* (SVD) that can decompose the training set matrix $X$ into the matrix multiplication of three matrices $U \\Sigma V^T$, where V contains all the principal components that we are looking for.\n",
    " \n",
    " The following Python code uses NumPy's svd() function to obtain all the principal components of the training set, then extracts the first two PCs:"

    "### PCA for Compression\n",
    "\n",
    "Obviously after dimensionality reduction, the training set takes up much less space. For example, try applying PCA to the MNIST dataset while preserving 95% of its variance. You should find that each instance will have just over 150 features, instead of the original 784 features. So while most of the variance is preserved, the dataset is now less than 20% of its original size! This is a reasonable compression ratio, and you can see how this can speed up a classification algorithm (such an SVM classifier) tremendously.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is also possible to decompress the reduced dataset back to 784 dimensions by applying the inverse transformation of the PCA projection. Of course this won't give you back the original data, since the projectio lost a bit of information (within the 5% variance that was dropped), but it will likely quite close to the original data. The mean squared distance between the original data and the reconstructed data (compressed and decompressed) is called the *reconstruction error*. For example, the following code compresses the MNIST dataset down to 154 dimensions, then uses the inverse_transform() method to decompress it back to 784 dimensions. "

Its computational complexity is $O(m \\times d^2) +O(d^3)$, instead of $O(m \\times n^2) +O(n^3)$ for the full SVD approach, so it is dramatically faster than full SVD when d is much smaller than n:"

    "One problem with the preceding implementation of PCA is hat they require the whole training set to fit in memory in order for the algorithm to run. Fortunately, *Incremental* PCA (IPCA) algorithms have been developed: you can split the training set into mini-batches and feed an IPCA algorithm one mini-batch at a time. This is useful for large training sets, and also to apply PCA online (i.e. on the fly, as new instances arrive).\n",

    "The following code splits the MNIST dataset into 100-mini-batches (using numpy's array_split() function) and feeds them to Scikit-Learn's IncrementalPCA class to reduce the dimensionality of the MNIST dataset down to 154 dimensions (just like before). Note that you must call the partial_fit() method with each mini-batch rather than the fit() method with the whole dataset:"

    "In chapter 5 we discussed the kernel trick, a mathematical technique that implicitly maps instances into a very high-dimensional space (called the *feature space*), enabling nonlinear classification and regression with Support Vector Machines. Recall that a linear decision boundary in the high-dimensional space corresponds to a complex nonlinear decision boundary in the *original space*.\n",
    "\n",
    "It turns out that the same trick can be applied to PCA, making it possible to perform complex nonlinear projections for dimensionality reduction. This is called *Kernel* PCA (kPCA). It is often good at preserving clusters of instances after projection, or sometimes even unrolling datasets that lie close to a twisted manifold.\n",

    "As kPCA is an unsupervised learning algorithm, there is no obvious performance measure to help you select the best kernel and hyperparameter values. However, dimensionality reduction is often a preparation step for a supervised learning task (e.g. classification), so you can simply use grid search to select the kernel and hyperparameters that lead to the best performance on that task. \n",

Notice that if we could invert the linear PCA step for a given instance in the reduced space, the reconstructed point would lie in feature space, not in the original space (e.g. like the one represented by an x in the diagram). Since the feature space is infinite-dimensional, we cannot compute the reconstruted point, and therefore we cannot compute the true reconstruction error. \n",

    "*Locally Linear Embedding* (LLE) is another very powerful *nonlinear dimensionality reduction* (NLDR) technique. It is a Manifold Learning technique that does not rely on projections like the previous algorithms. In a nutshell, LLE works by first measuring how each training instance linearly relates to its closest neighbors, and then looking for a low-dimensional repreentation of the trainining set where these local relationships are best preserved. This makes it particularly good at unrolling twisted manifolds, especially when there is not too much noise.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, the following code uses Scikit-Learn's LocallyLinearEmbedding class to unroll the Swiss roll. The resulting 2D Dataset is shown in the figure below. As you can see, the Swiss roll is completely unrolled and the distances between instances are locally well preserved. However, distances are not preserved on a larger scale: the left part of the unrolled Swiss roll is stretched, while the right part is squeezed. Nevertheless, LLE did a pretty good job at modeling the manifold."

    "Here's how LLE works: first, for each training instance $x^{(i)}$, the algorithm identifies its k closest neighbors (in the preceding code k = 10), then tries to reconstruct $x^{(i)}$ as a linear function of these neighbors. More specifically, it finds the weights $w_{i,j}$ such that the squared distance between $x^{(i)}$ and $\\sum_{j = 1}^m w_{i,j}x^{(j)}$ is as small as possible, assuming $w_{i,j} = 0$ if $x^{(j)}$ is not one of the k closest neighbors of $x^{(i)}$.\n",
    "\n",

Now the second step is to map the training instances into a d-dimensional space (where d < n) while preserving these local relationships as much as possible. if $z^{(i)}$ is the image of $x^{(i)}$ in this d-dimensional space, then we want the squared distance between $z^{(i)}$ and $\\sum_{j = 1}^m w_{i,j} z^{(j)}$ to be as small as possible. This idea leads to the unconstrained described in the below equation. It looks very similar to the first step, but instead of keeping the instances fixed and finding the optimal weights, we are doing the reverse: keeping the weights fixed and finding the optimal position of the instances' images in the low-dimensional space. Note that Z is the matrix containing all $z^{(i)}$\n",

Unfortunately, the $m^2$ in the last term makes this algorithm scale poorly to very large datasets.\n",

    "\n",

    "- *Isomap* creates a graph by connecting each instance to its nearest neighbors, then reduces dimensionality while trying to preserve the *geodesic distances* between the instances.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *t-Distributed Stochastic Neighbor Embedding* (t-SNE) reduces dimensionality while trying to keep similar instances close and dissimilar instances apart. It is mostly used for visualization, in particular to visualize clusters of instances in high-dimensional space (e.g., to visualize the MNIST images in 2D).\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- *Linear Discriminant Analysis* (LDA) is actually a classification algorithm, but during training it learns the most discriminative axes between the classes, and these axes can then be used to define a hyperplane onto which to project the data. The benefit is that the projection will keep classes as far apart as possible, so LDA is a good technique to reduce dimensionality before running another classification algorithm such as an SVM classifier."
